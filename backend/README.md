### 数据库

项目使用 SQLite 数据库 (`mineru_tianshu.db`),自动创建,无需手动配置。

## 🎯 核心功能

### 支持的解析引擎

| 引擎 | 名称 | 特点 | 适用场景 |
|------|------|------|----------|
| `pipeline` | MinerU Pipeline | 完整文档解析，支持表格、公式 | 通用文档处理 |
| `paddleocr-vl` | PaddleOCR-VL | 多语言 OCR，自动方向矫正 | 多语言文档 |
| `sensevoice` | SenseVoice | 音频转文字，说话人识别 | 音频处理 |
| `video` | Video Engine | 视频处理，关键帧 OCR | 视频分析 |
| `fasta` | FASTA Engine | 生物序列格式解析 | 生物信息学 |
| `genbank` | GenBank Engine | 基因序列格式解析 | 生物信息学 |

### Worker 主动拉取模式

- Workers 持续循环拉取任务,无需调度器触发
- 默认 0.5 秒拉取间隔,响应速度极快
- 空闲时自动休眠,不占用 CPU 资源

### 并发安全

- 使用 `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` 和原子操作
- 防止任务重复处理
- 支持多 Worker 并发拉取

### 多解析器支持

- **MinerU**: 完整文档解析，支持表格、公式等 (GPU 加速)
- **PaddleOCR-VL**: 高精度视觉语言模型 OCR (可选)
- **MarkItDown**: 处理 Office、HTML、文本等 (快速处理)

### 自动清理

- 自动清理旧结果文件 (默认 7 天)
- 保留数据库记录供查询
- 可配置清理周期或禁用

## 🐍 Python 客户端示例

```
from client_example import TianshuClient
import asyncio

async def main():
    client = TianshuClient('http://localhost:8000')

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        # 提交任务
        result = await client.submit_task(
            session,
            file_path='document.pdf',
            backend='pipeline',
            lang='ch',
            formula_enable=True,
            table_enable=True
        )

        task_id = result['task_id']

        # 等待完成
        final_status = await client.wait_for_task(session, task_id)

        print(f"Task completed: {final_status}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🔍 故障排查

### Worker 无法启动

检查 GPU:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

检查依赖:

```bash
pip list | grep -E "(mineru|litserve|torch)"
```

### 任务一直 pending

检查 Worker 是否运行:

```bash
# Windows
tasklist | findstr python

# Linux/Mac
ps aux | grep litserve_worker
```

检查 Worker 健康状态:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"health"}'
```

### 显存不足

减少 worker 数量:

```bash
python start_all.py --workers-per-device 1
```

设置显存限制:

```bash
export MINERU_VIRTUAL_VRAM_SIZE=6
python start_all.py
```

## 🔌 MCP 协议支持

### 什么是 MCP？

Model Context Protocol (MCP) 是 Anthropic 推出的开放协议，让 AI 助手（如 Claude Desktop）可以直接调用外部工具和服务。

### 启用 MCP Server

```bash
python start_all.py --enable-mcp
```

MCP Server 将在 `http://localhost:8001` 启动，提供以下端点：

- `/sse` - SSE 连接端点（MCP 客户端连接）
- `/messages` - POST 消息端点
- `/health` - 健康检查端点

### 可用工具

1. **parse_document** - 解析文档为 Markdown 格式
2. **get_task_status** - 查询任务状态和结果
3. **list_tasks** - 列出最近的任务
4. **get_queue_stats** - 获取队列统计信息
